# Personal Artificial Intelligence Operating System (pAI-OS)

## Getting Started

|❗ The server binds to localhost without authentication for the time being; this is a security issue that will be fixed before release to end users. You can use any username and password for the time being.|

### Users

An easy to use release is coming soon, but for now you can follow the instructions below to get started.

### Early Adopters

> 💡 **Tip:** Download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you can't run it from the terminal.

Open the Terminal application.

Clone the canary branch from the repository:

```sh
git clone --branch canary --single-branch https://github.com/pAI-OS/paios.git
```

Setup and run the server:

_POSIX (Linux/macOS/etc.)_

```sh
python3 paios/scripts/setup_environment.py (only on first run)
source paios/.venv/bin/activate
python3 -m paios
```

_Windows_

```sh
python .\paios\scripts\setup_environment.py (only on first run)
.\paios\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m paios
```

Visit [http://localhost:3080/](http://localhost:3080/)

### Developers

Clone the entire repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Kwaai-AI-Lab/paios.git
```

> 🤖 **Tip:** Early Adopters don't need to build the frontend on the canary branch because it's done automatically on every commit to main.

Build the frontend:

```sh
cd frontend
npm run build
cd ..
```

Run the uvicorn server:

```sh
python -m paios
```
