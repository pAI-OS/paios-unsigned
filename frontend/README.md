# pAI-OS Frontend

## Users

The frontend is served from the same server as the backend so there's nothing to do here.

## Developers

Enter the pAI-OS frontend source directory:

    cd frontend

Install the application dependencies by running:

```sh
npm install
```

Start the application in development mode by running:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Production

Build the application in production mode by running:

```sh
npm run build
```

## DataProvider

The included data provider use [ra-data-json-server](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/tree/master/packages/ra-data-json-server). It fits REST APIs powered by [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server), such as [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

You'll find an `.env` file at the project root that includes a `VITE_JSON_SERVER_URL` variable. Set it to the URL of your backend.
